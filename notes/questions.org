* 02 Statistical Learning

- pg 34. In talking about a test set, they talk about y_0 and x_0, I
  don't understand what they're getting at.

- pg 36, figure 2.12, really understand this.

- pg 37, are we supposed to understand how bayes estimator is implemented?
  - Do I need to understand the bayes error rate?

- pg 50, that pairs equation, how does it work?
  - ALSO SO FUCKING COOL, holy shit
* 03 Linear Regression
- pg 66 - go back and understand these equations.
- pg 67 - What is the relationship between t-value p-value and
  confidence intervals?
- pg 74 - What, mathematicall, does it mean to "hold TV and radio
  fixed"?
- pg 82 - Can we talk about confidence interval vs prediction
  interval?

** Overall questions

- Can we talk about the relationships between RSS, SE, TSS, and the rest
  of those?
  - Write them down
  - Talk about which are independently useful
  - Talk about what they mean in words

- Can we talk about the potential problems?

- Leverage, maybe I should understand this?

- I still want to better understand how collinearity affects models.
  - Does the wildly differen parameter estimate fit with the way that
    a given variable affects another?

** Exercise Questions

- Why the focus on regression without an intercept. It seems, silly?
  - Is it because you can always normalize your response to have mean zero?
  - Still, these questions seem unmotivated

- 14.f -- I don't understand this
