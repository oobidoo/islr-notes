* 4 Classification

Regression assumes the response variable is quantitative. Often,
though, the response is qualitative (categorical).

- classification :: approaches for predicting qualitative responses.

Often classification methods predict a probability of each class using
regression techniques.

We discuss 3 here:

- Logistic regression
- Linear discriminant analysis
- K-nearest neighbors

We'll discuss more computationally expensive techniques in later
chapters.
